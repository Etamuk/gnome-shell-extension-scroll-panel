Scroll Panel

Gnome Shell Extension
-----
Scroll above an application's title to switch between windows on the active
workspace, and above the clock to switch between virtual workspaces.

Note: to use the touchpad, you probably have to configure its sensitivity in
the extension settings.

Get it from [extensions.gnome.org](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/932/).
